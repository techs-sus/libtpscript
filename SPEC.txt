# This spec is UNFINISHED. It was ment for a risc-v emulator, but that is so hard i aeuiwhdbgerigeuohqedoj

vm -> intrepret commands, and execute them

aot -> [
	* create an ast from an risc-v binary
	* emulate x11???
	* compile directly to lua bytecode (oh no)
]

jit -> [
	* basically the vm but we will do dynamic optimizations
	* should be atleast 3% faster than vm
]
